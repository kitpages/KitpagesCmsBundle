Why this CMS ?
==============
We are developping this CMS because the opensource CMS we found on the market were
too complex for our clients.

The goals of this CMS are :

* a super easy to use CMS for non technical people
* a CMS that can be integrated in an existing symfony2 project
* editorial contents managed by the CMS can be added to a dynamic page
* no administration page exept the website tree.
* good for performances

State of the project
====================

In production state.

We are are using this CMS at Kitpages for our client websites.

Features
========

* Edition of contents
* edition/preview/production mode
* change page layout and block template freely
* upload images on local server or on Amazon S3
* resize images while you edit your contents
* can be integrated as a simple bundle in an existing website
* manage navigation
* small news/blog system integrated
* you remain in a very standard symfony2 website. You can use any symfony2 bundle you want.
There's no need for a specific module system for the CMS.
