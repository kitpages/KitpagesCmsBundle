(This assumes you already read the README.md of the bundle)

There's two ways to install the Kitpages CMS :

* [Quick Install][10.10-QuickInstall.md] : Installation based on a Symfony2 distribution
* [Custom Installation][10.20-CustomInstallation.md] : The Kitpages CMS Bundle is installed step by step in an existing symfony2 project
